The idea of this project was to make a train an image recognition model based off of my personal collection of wildlife. This is the opposite of most image recognition models as they are usually trained on thousands of photos gathered from a variety of sources.
It being based off of my photos is supposed to make it more of my personal image recognition model than just a general image recognition model and also a look into my life, as well as a look into my photography. 
A cross between my three passions of photography, machine learning, and programming. So it won't recognise a JUST a cat but specifically the neighbourhood cat, who goes around the backyards; Pomegranate, who's my sister's cat. It won't recognise just a fish, it'll recognise Sasuke and Naruto and Co, my fishes, whom are beloved.
